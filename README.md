# EnglishUser

To develop your own app to learn English. That sounds interesting isn't it? 

In this APP, I have already implemented Speaking Question, in which all questions come from TOEFL SPEAKING SECTION. Users can write down their own answer in the EditText area and all data will be saved automatically/manuallyã€‚



# Library:

In the process of making this APP, some libraries are used as follows:
- XLog
- xrefreshview
- greendao
- retrofit2

The news data comes from [The Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/)

# Next Plan

- News List
- YouDao Translator
- others...
