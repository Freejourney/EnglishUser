# EnglishUser

To develop your own app to learn English. That sounds interesting isn't it? 

In this APP, I have already implemented :
- Speaking Question, in which all questions come from TOEFL SPEAKING SECTION. Users can write down their own answer in the EditText area and all data will be saved automatically/manually.
- Reading News, News come from The Guardian. Users can get the news list by sliding from right to left and relevant detailed news will be shown in a webview.(Better user experience will be improved in later)


# Library:

In the process of making this APP, some libraries are used as follows:
- XLog
- xrefreshview
- greendao
- retrofit2

The news data comes from [The Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/)

# Next Plan

- YouDao Translator
- others...
